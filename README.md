## Introduction

SEEMPS is the SElf-Explaining Matrix-Product-State library.

It is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that literary programming
Python implementation of Matrix-Product-State algorithms. The
notebooks combine brief explanations of the algorithms and the details
of the implementations. We have chosen the most essential algorithms
in their simplest form, so as to provide a gentle introduction to the
field.

The library is thought out as introduction to the world of Matrix
Product States and DMRG-inspired algorithms. Its main goal is not
performance, but rapid prototyping and testing of ideas, providing a
good playground before dwelling in more advanced (C++, Julia) versions
of the algorithms.

## Requirements

The library is entirely developed in Python 3 using Numpy and Scipy,
and a standard Jupyter environment. We recommend using Anaconda3 or
Miniconda3, although any other distribution of Python should suffice.
